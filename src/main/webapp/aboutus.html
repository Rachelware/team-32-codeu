    <h1>About Our Team</h1>
    <h2>Mia Boloix</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Summer Feelz: Over the summer, I am leading a project for a start-up that I work for on campus at Hopkins. The project is to integrate a Hopkins tutoring service's registration on the start-up's website (the website is a student course scheduling platform) and the tutoring service is extremely popular! I am so excited to be leading, designing, and planning this part of the platform :) I am also interning at an incubation company for start-ups in Irvine named Forkaia, learning the ropes! On top of this, I am   taking an online math class and living in a house with some of my friends who are also working in the area! </li>
      <li>Aspirational Hobby: I love solving puzzles and brainstorming! I also run a club at Hopkins, which often involves planning and a ton of collaboration with my peers. I find myself in leadership and managerial roles often and really feel it is where I thrive. I one day wish to work as a technical project manager, planning and overseeing projects that make the world a better, cleaner, and more compassionate place! </li>
