            <p> On your page, you will be presented with a puzzle. <p>
            <p>Starting on level 1, each puzzle is accompanied by a chat room full of others attempting to solve that same puzzle! <p>
            <p>You can post messages and help each other out!</p>
            <p>Once you solve the puzzle, you are immediately pushed into the next level and entered into a new chat room filled with new people also on your level.</p>
            <p>Each level gets successively harder, and once you reach the end - you have successfully ESCAPED!</p>
            <p><b>Good luck!</b></p>
